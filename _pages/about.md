I am a first year PhD student at [SecLab](https://seclab.cs.ucsb.edu/members/)@UCSB, advised by [Prof. Giovanni Vigna](https://sites.cs.ucsb.edu/~vigna/) and [Prof. Christopher Kruegel](https://sites.cs.ucsb.edu/~chris/). My previous research focuses on Web Security, while I am currently working on how to use LLMs to improve the performance of static analysis and fuzzing. Additionally, I participate in CTFs as a member of [Shellphish](https://shellphish.net/) and [0ops](https://0ops.sjtu.cn/). I am also a part of the AIxCC team at Shellphish, where I built components that utilize LLMs to discover vulnerabilities.
